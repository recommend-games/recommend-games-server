# ðŸŽ² Recommend.Games Server ðŸš€

Board game recommendation service. Live demo at
[Recommend.Games](https://recommend.games/)

## Quick start

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build the docker image (only on first start) and run the server.
You should be able to access the service at
[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

However, in order to access useful data, you need to fill the SQLite database
first. See [`release.sh`](release.sh) for the steps to build a full release or
read [more about the deployment process](DEPLOY.md).

## Recommendation engine

Personal recommendations are based on data from
[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) and computed by our
[recommendation engine](https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/board-game-recommender).
